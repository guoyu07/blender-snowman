## Snowman's head

Now we need a head for the snowman. Let's add another UV sphere.

+ On the left hand panel, go the Toolbox. Select **Create** then **UV Sphere**.

Another UV sphere has been added to your 3D scene but you might not be able to see it. This is because the second UV sphere was added inside the snowman's bottom, so we need to drag it out.

+ Select the arrow ends, move tool from the menu below.

+ Drag the UV sphere out using the blue handle (z-axis) and place the UV sphere on top of the other sphere to make the head.

+ Now press <kbd>F12</kbd> (or <kbd>FN + F12</kbd> if you're working on a Mac), to see what the image looks like. For example:

The head may look a bit big, so let's shrink it down.

+ Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to get out of the render view. Select the head UV sphere then press <kbd>S</kbd> to resize the object. Drag and move the mouse towards the centre of the object to make it smaller.

+ Render again to see what the image looks like. For example:

If the head is still too big, resize again to make it smaller. If it's too small resize again to make it bigger.

+ The head might not be stuck onto the snowman's bottom. Move the head onto the bottom using the handles. Check this by rendering the image. For example:
